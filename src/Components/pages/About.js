      <h1>About Me Page</h1>
      <p> Thank you for reviewing my portfolio.</p>
       <p>
        Most of my career comes from an Administrative Assistant and Sales background. 
        This has given me an eye for detail and I am able to coordinate multiple projects at a time.</p>
        <p>
        I transitioned from sales into the IT side of business a couple years ago. This opened my eyes to a whole new world that 
        I wanted to learn and know more about.  My role as an IT Coordinator was to communicate between the company I worked 
        for and the 3rd party company that handled their network structure.</p>
       <p>
        When I walked into the position not understanding the fundamentals of networking. Over the course of a year 
        I was able to turn the department around and streamline information properly. Going into my second year; 
        I decided I wanted to learn more...so I enrolled in Rice’s Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.</p>
        <p>
        I ended up quitting my job of 8 years and decided to dedicate my time to the coursework. 
        I (laughingly) thought it would be easy to stay at home with my 3 year old son and be able to get all my work done… 
        Did you know that children are needy? I look forward to working on more projects and learning more.</p>
        <p>
        You can do anything as long as you have inspiration and are driven to succeed
